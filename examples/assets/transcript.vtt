Oceans are deep as well as wide.

2
00:00:07.739 --> 00:00:10.074
Scientists estimate

3
00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:13.074
that about one million species of animals

4
00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:16.074
live in the ocean.

5
00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:19.074
But most of them—95 percent—are invertebrates,

6
00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.074
animals that don’t have a backbone, such as jellyfish and shrimp.

7
00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:31.074
Dolphins, porpoises, and sea lions are also ocean-dwelling mammals.

8
00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.074
The largest animal ever to live on Earth is an ocean mammal called the blue whale.

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.074
It’s as long as two school buses!
